# Pong-game
A simple, terminal-based version of the classic Snake game, built using Python's Turtle graphics. The player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The game ends when the snake runs into the wall or itself. This is a great beginner project to learn event handling, collision detection, and game loops in Python.
